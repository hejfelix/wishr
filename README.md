# WishR

## What is it?

It's a full-stack Scala wish list web-app. 

## Main dependencies:

#### Server
* http4s http://http4s.org/
* doobie https://github.com/tpolecat/doobie

#### Client
* scalajs-react https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react
* scalajs-react-components https://github.com/chandu0101/scalajs-react-components

## Disclaimer

__It is built by me and for me.__ This is a learning project and has only been set up to run on Heroku so far. It does, however, _build and run inside docker containers_, so with a little love it could be migrated to AWS or whatever.
For now, the footprint is small enough that everything can be run on *the free tier* at Heroku.
